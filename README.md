# Data-Analysis
In the last couple of weeks I learned Data Analysis with the book "Python for Data Analysis". To better myself in the field  I try to do some projects with real-world-examples 

The Corona-file outlines some interesting facts about the mortality and infection rate in Germany and then compared to other countries in the world.
The Datasets are from the Robert-Koch-Institut for the german data and from Kaggle for the international dataset

The Movies-file makes use of an dataset containing movies with other interesting info like their genre, production-companie, Ratings and many more.
This allowed me to so some data-wrangling because the data was pretty messy at first. After that I could derive some interesting facts by computing the genre with the best rating or
the production-companies with the best movies (these two are correlated).
